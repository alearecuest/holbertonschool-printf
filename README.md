# Proyect PRINTF

## First Task

### Handle Conversion Specifiers

#### Description of Task

##### For this task, you need to implement a custom function _printf that mimics the behavior of the printf function from the C standard library. Based on the prototype: int _printf(const char *format, ...); the created function should return the number of characters printed, excluding the null byte used to end strings. The output should be written to stdout, the standard output stream. The format string can contain zero or more directives. You need to handle the following conversion specifiers: %c, %s, and %%. For this task, you do not need to reproduce the buffer handling of the printf function from the C standard library, nor the flag characters, field width, precision, or length modifiers.


## Second Task

### Implement the _printf function to handle integer specifiers

#### Description of Task

##### In this project, you are required to handle conversion specifiers in C. The conversion specifiers you need to work with in this task are d and i. Both are used to print integer values in decimal format. You will need to implement the logic to handle these specifiers when they appear in a format string. For this initial task, you do not need to worry about flag characters, field width, precision, or length modifiers. You will only focus on the basic conversion of integers.
